// [Sean Kelley]:
// Weird stuff happens when the contents of the popup change the size of the actual popup's container.
// In particular, stuff gets extra weird over some internal arbitrary height limit that Chrome has, an
// the popup might end up with two scroll bars, which is pretty sad. Experimentally, 500px is below
// the cutoff. To experience the weirdness for yourself, raise this limit really high then add a bunch
// of task list items until it's well over the limit for scrolling and then try to scroll.
