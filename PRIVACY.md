# Privacy Policy

NAS Download Manager asks for your login credentials for your OpenMediaVault NAS in order to view and manage your download tasks. Your login credentials are stored locally to the browser in a place accessible only to NAS Download Manager. Your credentials are only ever transmitted to the host you specify in the settings.

**NAS Download Manager does not collect, store or transmit any other personal information, or use your credentials except to communicate with your NAS.** In particular, NAS Download Manager does not collect any usage information and does not sync any information between browsers.

## Permission Explanations

This section explains what each permission requested by NAS Download Manager is used for. You can find the list of requested permissions in [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/seansfkelley/nas-download-manager/blob/master/manifest.json), under the `permissions` section.

## Verifying Your Installation

If you are concerned that open-source extensions may not show you the same code that they actually publish to the browser add-on stores, you can follow these steps.

> These steps may be used for any other extension as well, accounting for any differences in the add-on layout or build process.

1. Ensure that you've checked out the appropriate version of the repo to compare to your version downloaded from the add-on store. You can get a list of names with `git tag`. Note that these verification instructions do not exist in all versions of the repository, so be sure to keep this copy of the instructions around.
2. Follow the instructions outlined in the [Development](./README.md#development) section of the README to build a distributable version of the addon.
3. Find the copy of this extension installed from the add-on store.

    In **Firefox**, visit `about:support` > Application Basics > Profile Folder to open your profile folder. There, you can find this extension at `extensions/{b17c0686-033c-4d03-b526-b16c99998c98}.xpi`.

4. Unzip the extension file into a folder (it may not have a `.zip` extension, but it is a zip file).
5. Inside you will see a subset of the file hierarchy that you see in your copy of the repo. All the Javascript is contained in `dist/js`.

    If you'd like to, you can scan the other files as well and verify that there is no executable code inside them. Most of them are CSS styles or JSON configuration.

6. Now that you have the extension built from the original source as well as the source from a copy downloaded from the add-on store, you can compare them and verify they are character-for-character equal.

    I suggest using a simple `diff -r <path-to-source>/dist/js <path-to-downloaded-addon>/dist/js` which will either output nothing or note that the from-source version has extra `.map` files (these are called "source maps" and are for development purposes, which is why they aren't in the version installed from the add-on store).

The last step is to verify that you trust the source of this extension and its dependencies. You can of course read the source here and note that it doesn't do anything other than what it advertises. Furthermore, the dependencies are also all open-source popular libraries that are thoroughly vetted (e.g. Lodash, React).
